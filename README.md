# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a convenient place to store any notes taken from the coding bootcamp's prework assignment. This webpage provides an easily accessible study guide that will never be lost or thrown away. Although I already knew the basics of HTML and CSS, I was able to get started on JavaScript and GitHub.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section of this study guide contains notes on the subject. For example, the HTML section will house any notes that I took on that subject throughout the prework assignment. Additionally, if the DevTools console is opened, the JavaScript can be seen running. It will list the various topics learned during the prework and a topic will be chosen to study first.
